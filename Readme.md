<h1>Object Relations Code Challenge - Restaurants<h1>

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Yelp-style domain.
 

We have three models:
- `Restaurant`
- `Customer`
- `Review`

For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Review`s, and a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.
 

`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many-to-many relationship.

<h2>Topics<h2>
